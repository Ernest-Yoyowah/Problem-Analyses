# Problem Analysis

Given an array of integers and a positive integer k, you are tasked with finding and counting pairs of elements from the array where the sum of the pair is divisible by k. Your goal is to provide an efficient algorithm to solve this problem.

## Input

- An integer n: The number of elements in the array.
- An integer k: A positive integer that the pair sum must be divisible by.
- An array of n integers: The list of integers to consider.

## Output

- An integer: The count of pairs whose sum is divisible by k.

# Algorithm

The problem can be solved using a straightforward algorithm involving nested loops. Here's a step-by-step algorithm to find the count of such pairs:

1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the count of valid pairs.

2. Iterate through the array using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from 0 to n-1, and the inner loop iterates from i+1 to n-1, ensuring that each pair is considered only once and no element is paired with itself.

3. For each pair of elements (arr[i], arr[j]) selected in the loops, calculate their sum.

4. Check if the sum of the pair (arr[i] + arr[j]) is divisible by k. If it is, increment the `count` by 1.

5. Continue iterating through the array and repeat the steps for all possible pairs.

6. Once both loops have completed, return the value of `count` as the result.

# Pseudocode

```pseudocode
function divisibleSumPairs(k, arr)
    count = 0
    n = length of arr

    for i from 0 to n-2
        for j from i+1 to n-1
            pair_sum = arr[i] + arr[j]
            if pair_sum is divisible by k
                increment count by 1

    return count
```
