# Computational Thinking Notes

## Problem Identification

### Key Considerations:

- **Topic**: What is the overarching problem? Can it be clearly stated in a problem statement, or is it too broad or vague?
- **Data**: What data or information do we possess to contribute to a problem-solving approach? What additional information might be necessary?

- **Feasibility**: Can we solve the problem with the available resources? Is the problem inherently solvable using a computer?

### Reflection:

Problem identification is the crucial first step in computational thinking. By examining the topic, data, and feasibility, we determine whether a problem is within the scope of computational solutions. A well-defined problem statement guides subsequent steps in the problem-solving process.

## Decomposition

### Strategies:

- **Breaking Down Problems**: Can we break the main problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems?

- **Avoiding Complexity**: If a problem seems too large or complicated, decomposition allows us to focus on solving simpler, well-defined pieces first.

- **Structured Approaches**: Techniques such as flowcharts or tree structures aid in breaking down and solving complex problems systematically.

### Importance:

Decomposition is a powerful technique to simplify problem-solving. By dividing a complex problem into smaller parts, it becomes more approachable. This step-by-step approach allows for focused solutions to individual components, contributing to an effective solution for the original problem statement.

## Pattern Recognition

### Aspects:

- **Familiar Patterns**: Identifying patterns that resemble problems solved previously.

- **Past Solutions**: Recognizing similarities to problems already addressed and applying solutions from those experiences.

- **Problem Familiarity**: Reflecting on how the current problem is similar or different from previously identified problems.

### Significance:

Pattern recognition leverages past experiences to streamline problem-solving. Recognizing patterns provides shortcuts and efficient solutions, reducing the time and effort required to tackle a problem.

## Abstraction

### Concepts:

- **Ignoring Non-essentials**: Filtering out or ignoring aspects of the problem that are non-essential to concentrate on necessary components.

- **Relevance Filtering**: Identifying less relevant aspects to ensure a successful outcome.

- **Avoiding Overcomplication**: Instances when considering unnecessary or too many components of a problem can lead to ineffective problem solutions.

### Application:

Abstraction allows us to focus on essential elements by discarding unnecessary details. This ensures a more streamlined problem-solving process, preventing overcomplication and improving the efficiency of arriving at effective solutions.
