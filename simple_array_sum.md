# Problem Analysis: Sum of Array Elements

## Problem Description

You are given an array of integers, and your task is to find the sum of its elements.

## Output

- Print the sum of the array's elements as a single integer.


## Problem Analysis

To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:
1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0 to store the cumulative sum.
2. Iterate through the array, adding each element to `sum` using the `+=` operator.
3. After the loop, `sum` will contain the sum of all elements in the array.
4. Print the value of `sum` as the output.

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n) - The algorithm iterates through the array once.
- Space Complexity: O(1) - The algorithm uses a single variable `sum` to store the sum, which does not depend on the size of the input.

This problem can be solved efficiently with a simple loop, making it a straightforward task in programming.
