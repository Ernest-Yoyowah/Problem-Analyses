## Problem Analysis

We need to create a program that takes three numbers as input from the user, adds them together, and then displays the sum.

## Algorithm

1. **Start**
2. Initialize three variables to store the input numbers: `num1`, `num2`, and `num3`.
3. Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in `num1`.
4. Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in `num2`.
5. Prompt the user to enter the third number and store it in `num3`.
6. Calculate the sum of the three numbers: `sum = num1 + num2 + num3`.
7. Display the result, which is the sum.
8. **End**

## Pseudocode

```plaintext
1. **Start**
2. Declare num1, num2, num3 as integers
3. Display "Enter the first number: "
4. Read num1 from the user
5. Display "Enter the second number: "
6. Read num2 from the user
7. Display "Enter the third number: "
8. Read num3 from the user
9. sum = num1 + num2 + num3
10. Display "The sum of", num1, "+", num2, "+", num3, "is", sum
11. **End**
```
