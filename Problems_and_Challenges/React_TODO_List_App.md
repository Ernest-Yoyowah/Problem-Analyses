# Project: React To-Do List App with Database Integration

## Problem Analysis

The project's objective is to create a React-based to-do list application with the following functionalities:

- **Add**: Users can add new tasks to the to-do list.
- **Delete**: Users can remove tasks from the to-do list.
- **Edit**: Users can modify existing tasks.
- **Database Integration**: The application should be linked to a database for storing and retrieving tasks.

## Algorithm for the Frontend (React)

### Step 1: Initialization
1. Set up a new React application using `create-react-app` or a similar tool.
2. Create the initial project structure.

### Step 2: Component Structure
1. Build the component structure, including components for the task list, task item, and task input form.
2. Create state variables to manage the list of tasks.

### Step 3: Add Functionality
1. Implement a function to add a new task to the list.
2. Create a form to input new tasks.
3. Update the state to include the new task.

### Step 4: Delete Functionality
1. Implement a function to delete a task from the list.
2. Add a delete button to each task item.
3. Update the state to remove the deleted task.

### Step 5: Edit Functionality
1. Implement a function to edit an existing task.
2. Add an edit button to each task item.
3. Create an editable task item component.
4. Update the state with the edited task.

### Step 6: Styling
1. Apply CSS or use a styling library to make the app visually appealing.
2. Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes.

### Step 7: Database Integration
1. Choose a backend technology for your database (e.g., Node.js with Express and MongoDB).
2. Create API endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
3. Use Axios or a similar library to make HTTP requests to the backend.
4. Implement the logic to send and retrieve data to/from the database.

## Pseudocode for the Backend

```javascript
// Import necessary modules and set up your server
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Connect to MongoDB database
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/todoapp', { useNewUrlParser: true });

// Create a schema for tasks
const taskSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  description: String,
});

// Create a model for tasks
const Task = mongoose.model('Task', taskSchema);

// Define API endpoints for CRUD operations
// Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete routes here

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
