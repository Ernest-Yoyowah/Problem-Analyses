## Problem Analysis

The problem is to convert a given decimal number into its binary representation. In binary representation, numbers are expressed using only two digits: 0 and 1. The algorithm should take a decimal number as input and return its binary representation as a string.

## Algorithm

The algorithm to convert a decimal number to binary is as follows:

1. Start with the decimal number you want to convert.
2. Initialize an empty string to store the binary representation.
3. Repeat the following steps until the decimal number becomes zero:
   - Divide the decimal number by 2.
   - Record the remainder of the division (either 0 or 1). This is the next binary digit.
   - Update the decimal number to be the result of the division (integer division, discarding any remainder).
   - Prepend the recorded binary digit to the front of the binary representation string.
4. When the decimal number becomes zero, the binary representation is complete.
5. The binary representation string now contains the binary equivalent of the original decimal number.

## Pseudocode

```plaintext
function decimal_to_binary(decimal_num):
    if decimal_num == 0:
        return "0"  # Special case for decimal 0

    binary_str = ""  # Initialize an empty string to store binary digits

    while decimal_num > 0:
        remainder = decimal_num % 2  # Get the remainder
        binary_str = str(remainder) + binary_str  # Prepend to binary string
        decimal_num //= 2  # Update the decimal number

    return binary_str

# Example usage:
decimal_num = 10
binary_representation = decimal_to_binary(decimal_num)
output("The binary representation of", decimal_num, "is", binary_representation)
```
