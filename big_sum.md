# Problem Analysis: A Very Big Sum

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers, some of which may be very large. Your task is to calculate and return the sum of all the integers in the array.

## Input

- An integer `n`, representing the number of elements in the array.
- An array `ar` of `n` integers.

## Output

- A long integer representing the sum of all elements in the array.

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10`
- `-10^10 <= ar[i] <= 10^10`

## Algorithm

1. Initialize a variable `total` to 0. This variable will store the sum of the elements.

2. Iterate through the array `ar` from index 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, add it to the `total` using the following formula: `total = total + ar[i]`.

3. After the loop is completed, `total` will contain the sum of all elements in the array.

4. Return `total` as the result.

## Pseudocode

```plaintext
function aVeryBigSum(n, ar):
    total = 0                   // Initialize the sum to 0
s
    for i from 0 to n-1:        // Iterate through the array
        total = total + ar[i]   // Add the current element to the total

    return total               // Return the total sum as a long integer
