# Problem Description: A Very Big Sum

## Problem Statement

In this challenge, you are required to calculate and print the sum of the elements in an array, keeping in mind that some of those integers may be quite large.

## Function Description

Complete the `aVeryBigSum` function. It must return the sum of all array elements.

### Input

The function `aVeryBigSum` takes two parameters:
- An integer `n`, representing the number of elements in the array.
- An array `ar` of `n` integers.

### Output

The function should return a `long` integer, which is the sum of all array elements.

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10`
- `-10^10 <= ar[i] <= 10^10`

## Example

### Input

```plaintext
n = 5
ar = [1000000001, 1000000002, 1000000003, 1000000004, 1000000005]
